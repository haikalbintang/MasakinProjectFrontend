## About the Website

In todayâ€™s world of technological advancements, convenience is essential. **Masakin** understands this and aims to simplify the process of searching for new cooking recipes for home cooks or busy professionals who cook their own food. **Masakin** allows users to search for various recipes based on different criteria such as popularity, rating, and country of origin. Users can filter recipes, view detailed recipe information, and save their favorite recipes.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** User registration and login functionalities.
- **Recipe Search:** Search for recipes through name.
- **Recipe Filtering:** Filter recipes by popularity, rating, and country of origin.
- **Recipe Details:** View detailed information about each recipe.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** server-side rendering and routing.
- **React:** building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** styling.
- **TypeScript:** type checking and improved developer experience.
- **Axios:** making HTTP requests.
- **API:** backend endpoints.

## API Integration

You can check the API documentation [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/32137902/2sA3e1DAgX#2db4831c-4a7b-4265-8877-4442da959993) and its repository [here](https://github.com/imanmaris99/MasakinProjectBackend)

The API is connected to a backend with database for users and recipes. Recipes are currently posted manually by developers, but in the future users are hopefully able to post their own recipes.
